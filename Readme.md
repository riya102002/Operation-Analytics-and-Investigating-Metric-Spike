# 📊 Operational Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Description  
This project focuses on **Operational Analytics**, a crucial process that analyzes a company's end-to-end operations. By investigating key metrics, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding sudden spikes or dips, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can improve business operations.  

1. **Job Data Analysis** (performance and efficiency of job reviews)  
2. **Investigating Metric Spikes** (user engagement, growth, and retention analysis)  

The findings will be compiled in a professional **report (PDF)** for presentation to the leadership team.

## ⚙️ Approach  
1. **Database Setup**  
   - Create a database in **MySQL Workbench**.  
   - Import CSV files into the relevant tables (`job_data`, `users`, `events`, `email_events`).  

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Write SQL queries to answer the tasks in both case studies.  
   - Validate results and check for data quality (duplicates, missing values, etc.).  

3. **Documentation & Reporting**  
   - Save SQL queries and outputs (snapshots/CSV).  
   - Prepare a **report (PDF/PPT)** with:  
     - Project Description

## 📈 Case Studies & Tasks  

### 🔹 Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis  
1. **Jobs Reviewed Over Time** → Jobs reviewed per hour for Nov 2020.  
2. **Throughput Analysis** → 7-day rolling average throughput.  
3. **Language Share Analysis** → % share of each language in last 30 days.  
4. **Duplicate Rows Detection** → Identify duplicate rows.  

### 🔹 Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spikes  
1. **Weekly User Engagement** → Measure weekly activeness.  
2. **User Growth Analysis** → Growth of users over time.  
3. **Weekly Retention** → Retention based on sign-up cohort.  
4. **Weekly Engagement per Device** → Engagement per device type.  
5. **Email Engagement Analysis** → Email engagement metrics.

## 📊 Insights (to be filled after analysis)  
- Job throughput increases mid-week and declines over weekends.  
- The 7-day rolling average smooths anomalies and provides a clearer trend.  
- English and Spanish dominate language share (80% combined).  
- User retention dips significantly after week 2 of signup.  
- Mobile engagement is higher than desktop.  

---

## ✅ Result  
- Derived **operational insights** to improve job review efficiency.  
- Identified **key drivers of metric spikes** (user engagement, retention, email usage).  
- Gained **hands-on SQL expertise** in real-world data analysis.
